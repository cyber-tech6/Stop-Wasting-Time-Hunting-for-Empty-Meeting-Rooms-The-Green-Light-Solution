Every office knows the struggle. Someone books a room, but nobody shows up. Or worse, you walk around searching for a free space, only to find every door shut with people already inside. It’s frustrating, it wastes time, and it kills productivity. The good news? There’s a more innovative way to manage meeting spaces that saves both time and effort.

**The Daily Problem in Offices**
--------------------------------

Most companies face the same issue: too many meetings, not enough clear systems. Staff waste minutes, sometimes hours, walking around in search of a free spot.

Multiply that by dozens of people every week, and the wasted time becomes very costly. What’s needed is a clear and quick way to determine if a room is available or not.

**Evoko Meeting Room Solutions**
--------------------------------

This is exactly what [](https://www.eviggroup.com/room-booking-system)[**Evoko meeting room**](https://www.eviggroup.com/room-booking-system) **solutions** were created for. Evoko creates booking systems that instantly display whether a room is in use. A small light outside the room tells you everything. Green light? The room is free. Red light? Someone’s already inside. It’s simple, visual, and quick to understand.

Evoko systems eliminate the guesswork from room booking. Instead of running into “ghost meetings” (rooms booked but not used), the system automatically frees up unused spaces, allowing others to step in. This saves time and makes meetings run more smoothly.

**How the Green Light System Works**
------------------------------------

The green light idea is simple but powerful. Outside each meeting room is a touch screen with a glowing aura. The color changes depending on the room’s status. From down the hall, you can see whether it’s available or busy.

This little detail makes a huge difference in daily office life. No more knocking on doors or checking multiple calendars. The light tells you right away.

**More Than Just Rooms**
------------------------

Evoko doesn’t stop at meeting rooms. Their **Kleeo Desk Manager** is designed for desks in flexible offices. Many modern companies use hot-desking or shared spaces, and it can be not very clear to know which desk is free. Kleeo makes this easy. It shows the desk status with clear colors—green for available, red for taken, and even a focus mode for “do not disturb.”

By combining room booking with desk booking, Evoko provides offices with a single, integrated system. Employees stop wasting time searching and can focus on their work instead.

**Why Offices Like It**
-----------------------

● **Clarity at a glance:** Lights and touch screens mean no confusion.

● **No more wasted bookings:** Rooms free up automatically if nobody checks in.

● **Mobile friendly:** Staff can book rooms or desks from their phones.

● **Better data:** Managers can see how spaces are actually used and plan more effectively.

● **Smooth design:** The devices have a modern look and fit neatly into any office environment.

This blend of style and function makes the system popular in offices, schools, and co-working spaces alike.

**Evoko Meeting Room Solutions in Action**
------------------------------------------

One of the most popular products is the Evoko Liso. It’s a self-hosted, on-premise system that connects with tools like Outlook or Google Calendar. It’s perfect for businesses that want full control over their booking setup.

For those who prefer cloud systems, the Evoko Naso is ideal. It updates automatically, scales easily as a company grows, and works without the need for local servers. Together, these tools cater to the needs of both small businesses and large organizations.

**Why Kleeo Desk Manager Stands Out**
-------------------------------------

Flexible seating can be stressful if it’s not organized. The [**Kleeo Desk Manager**](https://www.eviggroup.com/news-and-events/kleeodeskmanager) [](https://www.eviggroup.com/news-and-events/kleeodeskmanager)makes it painless. Staff see straight away which desks are free. If someone wants to block out quiet time, focus mode makes it clear.

The system also collects data to indicate which desks are used most frequently, enabling companies to reduce wasted space and costs.

**About Evoko**
---------------

By utilizing tools like Evoko Liso, Naso, and the **Kleeo Desk Manager**, businesses can save hours every week and maximize their space. That’s the true power of a simple, clear system.
